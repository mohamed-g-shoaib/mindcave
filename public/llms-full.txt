# Mind Cave

> Your Digital Library, Perfectly Organized

Mind Cave is a production-ready bookmark manager and digital resource organizer built with Next.js and Supabase. It solves the problem of disorganized browser bookmarks by providing a dedicated, high-performance interface for resource management.

## Core Features

### Intelligent Resource Management

**Automated Metadata Extraction**
When you save a URL, Mind Cave fetches the page title, description, favicon, and OpenGraph image automatically. No manual data entry required.

**Browser Bookmarks Import**
Drag and drop your browser's exported bookmarks file. Mind Cave parses the HTML, lets you select which folders to import, and handles deduplication so you don't get duplicate entries.

**Custom Media Override**
If the auto-fetched favicon or preview image doesn't look right, you can upload your own.

**Category Organization**
Group bookmarks into categories. Each category has a name, color, and icon. There are 80+ icons to choose from, organized by type (development, media, education, finance, etc.).

### Dashboard Interface

**View Modes**
Switch between card view (visual grid with preview images) and list view (compact rows).

**Grid Density**
Adjust how many cards appear per row. Useful for different screen sizes and personal preference.

**Context Menus**
Right-click any bookmark or category for quick actions: edit, delete, copy URL, move to category.

**Bulk Operations**
Select multiple bookmarks and perform actions on all of them at once.

**Real-time Search**
Filter bookmarks instantly by typing. Search matches titles, descriptions, and URLs.

### Quality and Performance

**Lazy Loading**
Components render when they enter the viewport, reducing initial page load time.

**Responsive Design**
Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile. The layout adapts to screen size.

**Dark and Light Themes**
Follows your system preference with manual override available.

**Animations**
Smooth, subtle animations for interactions. Built with Framer Motion.

**Row Level Security**
Each user's data is isolated at the database level using Supabase RLS policies. Users can only access their own bookmarks.

## Authentication

Mind Cave uses Supabase Auth with Google OAuth provider. When a user signs in:

1. Supabase handles the OAuth flow
2. A user record is created or retrieved
3. The session is stored and sent to the client
4. All subsequent API calls include the session for authorization
5. RLS policies ensure users only see their own data
