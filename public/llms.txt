# Mind Cave

> Your Digital Library, Perfectly Organized

Mind Cave is a bookmark manager built for people who save a lot of links and need them to be findable. It replaces browser bookmark folders with a dedicated interface that fetches metadata automatically, organizes resources by category, and works across devices.

## What It Does

- Saves bookmarks with automatic metadata extraction (title, description, favicon, OpenGraph image)
- Organizes links into custom categories with icons and colors
- Imports existing bookmarks from browser exports
- Provides card and list view modes with adjustable density
- Supports dark and light themes
- Syncs across devices with secure authentication

## Who It's For

People who regularly save articles, documentation, tools, and resources for later reference. Developers, researchers, designers, students, and anyone who collects links.
